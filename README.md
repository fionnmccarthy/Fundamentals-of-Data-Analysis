This is my repository for the a module assessment in the Fundamentals of Data Analysis module. This repository contains two jupyter notebooks: 


1. pyplot.ipynb 

![xplotoutput](matplotlib_image.png)


This jupyter notebook will give an overview of the matplotlib.pyplot Python package and give an in-depth description of three plots I found most interesting from studying the package. 


2. cao.ipynb which pyplot.ipynb 

![xplotoutput](CAO_image.png)

This jupyter notebook will describe and show how you can load the CAO points information from the CAO website into a pandas data frame. The notebook then gives a detailed comparison with plots and other visualisations of CAO points in 2019, 2020 and 2021 with the use of pandas functions and other plotting techniques. 

I enjoyed the learning experience from the creation of this jupyter notebook and I found it to be an excellent way of exploring the the field of data analytics.
